GBM ARSI / NFKBIA Methylation Analysis

This repository contains R Markdown files, scripts, and data used to investigate the impact of GBM ARSI (Arylsulfatase Family Member 1) on glioblastoma patient survival. The analysis includes survival modeling, visualization, and gene expression comparisons using TCGA dataset.

Project Contents: 
Final_MD.Rmd — Full R Markdown analysis (survival models, statistical tests, plots)
HTML Knit output containing all code, outputs, and figures
Presentation
Folder containing final plots and figures

Analysis Overview

The analysis investigates:
Cox proportional hazards models
ARSI gene expression between GBM Subtypes (Classical, Mesenchymal, Neural, and Proneural)
Age-related survival index (ARSI) in GBM patients
Kaplan–Meier survival curves
Associations between methylation and survival
Associations between CNV and survival
Protein expression correlation using the RPPA dataset

Technologies Used: 
R (tidyverse, survival, survminer, ggplot2)
R Markdown
ggplot2 for visualization
Additional R packages for statistical modelling

How to Run the Analysis: 
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
Open Final_MD.Rmd in RStudio.
Install required R packages (listed at the top of the Rmd).
Knit the R Markdown file to produce HTML or PDF output.
